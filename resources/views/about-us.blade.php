                    <p class="mb-4">Founded in 2024, Dailytech started as a small blog by a group of tech enthusiasts
                        who
                        wanted to
                        share their passion for technology with the world. Over the years, we have grown into a trusted
                        source
                        for
                        tech news and analysis, with a dedicated team of writers and editors committed to delivering
                        high-quality
